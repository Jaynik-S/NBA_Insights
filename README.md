## üîç Archetypes

The application uses clustering algorithms to classify players into archetypes such as:
- All-Around Superstars
- High-Volume Scoring Guards
- Dominant Interior Forces
- Versatile Role Players
- Savvy Floor Generals
- And many more!

Each archetype is defined by a centroid in a multi-dimensional statistical space, and players are matched to archetypes based on their proximity to these centroids.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Details

- **Backend Framework**:
  - **Flask**: Powers the web development, routing, and session management
  - **Python**: Core language for data processing, ML model implementation, and API integration

- **Data Acquisition & Processing**:
  - **nba_api**: Enables retrieval of comprehensive NBA player statistics via NBA's official data sources
  - **Pandas**: Handles data manipulation, cleaning, and preprocessing of player statistics
  - **NumPy**: Provides mathematical operations, array manipulation, and numerical computing capabilities

- **Machine Learning Implementation**:
  - **Scikit-learn**: Powers the machine learning pipeline for player classification
  - **Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)**: Advanced probabilistic clustering algorithm to create player archetypes
  - **PCA (Principal Component Analysis)**: Dimensionality reduction technique for visualizing high-dimensional player statistics
  - **Standardization**: Feature scaling to normalize player statistics before clustering

- **Data Storage & Caching**:
  - **JSON**: Stores predefined centroids in `data/archetype_centroids.json`
  - **Pickle**: Serializes trained ML models (scaler and PCA) in `data/scaler.pkl` and `data/pca.pkl`
  - **In-memory caching**: Reduces API calls by storing player data during session
  - **Player statistics cache**: Implements a dictionary-based caching mechanism to avoid redundant API requests
